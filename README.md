# RECYCLECOIN
The future of recycling. A resolution for the trash crisis the world is facing. A possible move in the right direction concerning global warming. Hope for our homeless and under privedged. Recycle coin will issue governance tokens in order to push the innovation of recycling. This will revolve a strong tokenomics structure. Tokens that can be liquidated because these tokens are tethered to a tangible asset. The plastic, the aluminum, the tin, the gold, copper and silver we use in our everyday affairs. Materials that anyone can get their hands on. By offering an incentive to seperate the trash and recycle properly, we can also apply pressure to manufacturers by offering them credits for helping solve the packaging issue. Essentially, bringing everyone together on the field to have a discussion and decide together how to properly dispose and reduce, reuse and recycle our waste.
